# A Custom Discord Chat-bot
**by Mike Allison &copy; 2021**

This chatbot has been whipped together based on a tutorial shown on YouTube, some general JS knowhow and some silly ideas for what I wanted my bot to be able to do.

Now there have been many modifications done to the original bot, including a handful of new custom commands and responses, as well as potential future music playing capabilities!
