# A Custom Discord Chat-bot :robot:
**by Mike Allison &copy; 2021**

>**April 9th Update** :scroll:
This Discord bot is now to be the focus of my final presentation for SAIT's WBDV shotgun course, and the first of many bots to come.

[Invite the bot to your Discord server!](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=822664873347121162&permissions=8&scope=bot)

Plans are to create this and other bots for Twitter, Twitch, Instagram etc which can do anything from entertain/moderate users, to trawling databases and extracting the desired information.

In the beginning, this chatbot has been whipped together based on a tutorial shown on YouTube, a few other bot building tutorials, some of my own general JS knowhow and some silly ideas for what I wanted my bot to be able to do.

As of April 8th, this bot is hosted on Heroku and now live.
