# A Custom Discord Chat-bot
**by Mike Allison &copy; 2021**

This chatbot has been whipped together based on a tutorial shown on YouTube, a few other bot building tutorials, some of my own general JS knowhow and some silly ideas for what I wanted my bot to be able to do.

## Features so far
- Random Quotes
- Terrible Chuck Norris Jokes
- D20 Die Roller
